# Treasure-Hunt-Text-Game
A fun little turn-based treasure hunt game using conditional programming and a little bit of trolling.
Navigate through a treasure island surviving different scenarios. 
While it may look simple at first, small and minute errors will be majorly punished and involve a lot of trolling. There are some gacha aspects as well.
